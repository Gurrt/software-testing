Matthew = not Carl && not Matthew
Peter = Matthew || Jack
Jack = ( Carl || Mattthew ) && (not Matthew && not Jack)
Arnold = (not Carl && not Matthew && not Jack) || (Carl && not Jack)
Carl = (not Carl && not Matthew && Jack) || Carl && not Jack

Two lie and Tree speak the truth.

Arnold and Carl contradict eachother (Carl says that Arnold lies), so one of them must be lying.
Jack says that Matthew or Peter are lying, since there are only two liars and not three, Jack is lying.
Furthermore Arnold says that either Matthew or Peter is lying, but since Jack is a liar and either Arnold or Carl is lying, this means that Matthew and Peter both speak the truth and thus Arnold is lying.

Liars : Arnold, Jack
Truthful: Matthew, Peter, Carl
Thief : Jack
