-- Exercise 1

-- Question 1
-- I was wondering how I should read notion 5 in Theorem 4.38.
-- What does the "["insert-some-set-operations-here"]" mean compared to "("insert-someset-operations-here")" ?
-- Or is this a printing mistake?

-- Question 2
-- I used the term "notion" to address a part of a theorem in the question above. I was wondering if this is correct.
-- The beginning of the chapter briefly address the terms, however it seems not to address this specific question.

-- Question 3
-- In Haskell what is the difference between the usage of "case" and equation guarding?
-- To me the two seem oddly similar.

-- Concerning the logic in chapter 4 I have no specific questions.

-- Time spent: 3 hours.
